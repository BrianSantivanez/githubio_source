      <description>In version 5.4.0 of softlayer-python, there is a new slcli command for placing IaaS cloud server orders using the API. This command can also be used to place orders for products that are normally ordered through the IBM Cloud infrastructure customer portal. There are multiple helpers to assist you in creating a specific order. In these examples, you will learn how to:
 Build an order  Understand the order structure Search for server packages Identify categories of items Verify the order Place the order  Place an order programmatically using Python.</description>

      <description>The introduction of Flavors to VSI ordering significantly changes how VSIs are ordered, and the old style of ordering will eventually become unsupported. This page will hopefully explain what changes need to be made to any scripts that order VSIs.
Support for flavors has been added to the SLCLI, so make sure you have at least version 5.4.0.
Getting a Flavor List SoftLayer_Virtual_Guest::getCreateObjectOptions is where you can find out the flavor listing, along with all other options you might want to supply to SoftLayer_Virtual_Guest::createObject</description>

      <description>Object filters can be used to limit the results returned by the API. They differ from object masks in that they determine what Data Type objects are returned while Object Masks define what properties to retrieve from the returned objects.
Structure An object filter is created by defining a property hierarchy through the relational and local properties. The property to be filtered will be a structure that represents the object filters conditional.</description>

      <description>3/14/2012: Added the ability to provide SSL offloading to the local Load Balancing service in Softlayer. The load balancing service allows you to manage the offload capability, as well as, access the SSL certificate manager. In order to utilize SSL offloading, a load balancer must be purchased that offers the capability.
The SoftLayer_Security_Certificate service provides access to the new certificate manager. There are no restrictions on the number or origin of certificates, so please feel free to use it as a centralized storage location for all of your SSL certificates.</description>

      <description>Since writing this guide we&#39;ve created a Perl specific implementation and manual page. Check them out!
Our Perl SOAP API examples perform simple retrieval operations and output results to your Perl console. We use the SOAP::Lite Perl module to handle generating our SOAP headers, generating our SOAP request, then interpreting the result from the method call. Each of these examples execute a single method call to retrieve its data. We&#39;ll start out with a simple direct call, implement an object mask, then combine the two.</description>

A SOAP representation of the &amp;ldquo;authenticate&amp;rdquo; header looks like this:  MY_USERNAME MY_API_ACCESS_KEY   while it&amp;rsquo;s XML-RPC counterpart looks like this:    authenticate    username  MY_USERNAME    apiKey  MY_API_ACCESS_KEY</description>

      <description>Like any programming interface the SoftLayer API at times needs to return error messages to its users. The SoftLayer API brings these exceptions forward to the user so their application can handle the unexpected result. Exceptions are returned as SOAP or XML-RPC faults depending on the RPC method used to execute your API method call. Programming and scripting languages with SOAP and XML-RPC support usually have built-in methods for handling faults.</description>

      <description>Before You Start Choosing a Protocol SoftLayer&amp;rsquo;s API can be accessed by [[SOAP]], [[XML-RPC]], or [[REST|RESTful]] means. Choose the best protocol for your preferred language and situation. We generally recommend using our SOAP interface, as it&amp;rsquo;s the most comprehensive and most easily models the API&amp;rsquo;s services and data types.
    Advantages   Disadvantages   Recommended For   Recommended Languages      [[SOAP]]   It&amp;rsquo;s the fastest of the three protocols and allows you to make direct calls against SoftLayer&amp;rsquo;s API services and data types.</description>

      <description>The SoftLayer API is built around the same system of user permissions that power the SoftLayer customer portal. What the API exposes and allows depends on the authenticated user account that is making the call and that user&amp;rsquo;s permission set. Your account&amp;rsquo;s master user has full permissions to every service and method associated with your account. Please be wary if you choose to execute API method calls using your account&amp;rsquo;s master user.</description>

Endpoint URLs The SoftLayer XML-RPC API has one endpoint per available API service. Each endpoint has a unique URL containing the service name of the API services that it calls. For example: https://api.softlayer.com/xmlrpc/v3/&amp;lt;serviceName&amp;gt; or http://api.</description>
