      <description>Example of how to build an order for a bare metal server.
 Find the package that you want to order. listServerPackages() will filter out all that are not bare metal servers Use getServerPrices() to find the item keyNames you want to include in your order. These price IDs can be included prices array directly, but I&amp;rsquo;ve included gatherPriceIds() to match up KeyNames to build a list of price ids.</description>

      <description>As a SoftLayer user, you have probably seen the beautiful RAID Configurator that greets you when you order a server on the SoftLayer website.
It allows you to do anything you like, from a straight RAID configuration involving all drives in a single disk array, to a much more intricate configuration with nearly any mix of disks and RAID types.
However beautiful and practical the interface, sometimes you want to script this process, and the SoftLayer mantra of &amp;ldquo;Anything you can do in the Web interface, you can do on the API&amp;rdquo; also rings true in this case.</description>
