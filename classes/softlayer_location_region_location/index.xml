      <description>SoftLayer_Location_Region_Location Datatype   Description The SoftLayer_Location_Region_Location is very specific to the location where services will actually be provisioned. When accessed through a package, this location is the top priority location for a region. All new servers and services are provisioned at this location. When a server is ordered and a region is selected, this is the location within that region where the server will actually exist and have software/services installed.</description>
