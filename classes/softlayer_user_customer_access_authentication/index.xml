      <description>SoftLayer_User_Customer_Access_Authentication Datatype   Description SoftLayer_User_Customer_Access_Authentication models a single attempt to log into the SoftLayer customer portal. A SoftLayer_User_Customer_Access_Authentication record is created every time a user attempts to log into the portal. Use this service to audit your users&amp;rsquo; portal activity and diagnose potential security breaches of your SoftLayer portal accounts.
Unsuccessful login attempts can be caused by an incorrect password, failing to answer or not answering a login security question if the user has them configured, or attempting to log in from an IP address outside of the user&amp;rsquo;s IP address restriction list.</description>
