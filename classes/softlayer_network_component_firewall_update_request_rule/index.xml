      <description># Edit Standard Rule # A rule set of a firewall is modified by passing a SoftLayer_Network_Firewall_Update_Request template object # to SoftLayer_Network_Firewall_Update_Request::createObject. The entire rule set is rewritten with each # update request. This means it is necessary to include all past unchanged rules along with any modifications # or additions. This is easily accomplished by pulling in the existing rules as described above then modifying # the gathered array. # Each SoftLayer_Network_Component_Firewall_Update_Request_Rule object requires: # # action - permit or deny # destinationIpAddress - destination address # destinationIpSubnetMask - subnet mask for destination # sourceIpAddress - originating address # sourceIpSubnetMask - subnet mask for origin address # protocol - tcp/udp # destinationPortRangeStart - first port the rule will effect # destinationPortRangeEnd - last port the rule will effect # orderValue - order in which rules are applied (lower is sooner) # # Important manual pages: # http://sldn.</description>
