## [The Basics](#go-basics) {#go-basics .anchor-link}

The [softlayer-go](https://github.com/softlayer/softlayer-go) library helps users make API calls to the SoftLayer (aka IBM Cloud Classic Infrastructure) API.

To get started, here is a simple example.

(We are working in the `go/src/github.ibm.com/SoftLayer/sl-test` directory for these examples)
This file will be `main.go`

```go {linenos=table}
package main

import (
        "fmt"
        "github.com/softlayer/softlayer-go/sl"
        "github.com/softlayer/softlayer-go/session"
        "github.com/softlayer/softlayer-go/services"
)

func main() {
        // softlayer-go/session looks for username and apikey in ~/.softlayer file
        // or the SL_USERNAME/SL_API_KEY environment variables.
        sess := session.New()
        sess.Debug = true

        objectMask := "mask[id,hostname,domain]"

        // Looks for hostname starting with `spectrum`
        filterObject := string(`{"hardware":{"hostname":{"operation":"^=spectrum"}}}`)
        servers, err := services.GetAccountService(sess).Filter(filterObject).Mask(objectMask).GetHardware()
        if err != nil {
                fmt.Printf("\n Unable to get server object:\n - %s\n", err)
                return
        }
        fmt.Printf("Id, Hostname, Domain\n")
        for _,server := range servers {
            // use `sl.Get()` since API results are always memory addresses. This helper function makes
            // them a little easier to use
            fmt.Printf("%v, %v, %v\n", sl.Get(server.Id), sl.Get(server.Hostname), sl.Get(server.Domain))
        }
}
```

Then we need to download the libraries into the `go.mod` file.

```
go mod init
go mod tidy
```

Then just build and run

```
go build main.go
./main
Calling services.GetAccountService(sess).Filter(filterObject).Mask(objectMask).GetHardware()

```


## [Code Breakdown](#go-breakdown) {#go-breakdown .anchor-link}


### Package Name

Line 1 is easy enough, just set the package name, main works well if this is just for testing.

```go {linenos=table}
package main
```

### Imports

```go {linenos=table, linenostart=3}
import (
        "fmt"
        "github.com/softlayer/softlayer-go/sl"
        "github.com/softlayer/softlayer-go/session"
        "github.com/softlayer/softlayer-go/services"
)
```

The softlayer-go package has several sub-packages we can make use of.

1. `github.com/softlayer/softlayer-go/sl` Has some helper and error handling functions
2. `github.com/softlayer/softlayer-go/session` Will always be required, as it sets up the Authentication Session for actually making the API call
3. `github.com/softlayer/softlayer-go/services` These are autogenerated from the list of available Services in the SoftLayer API. When building an API call, you will first need an instance of the specific service you are working with.

Some other imports that are available, but not used here:

4. `github.com/softlayer/softlayer-go/datatypes` Has the datatype definitions, if you need them. Generally these are required if you are sending in data to the SoftLayer API, for example when ordering, or making changes to an object.
5. `github.com/softlayer/softlayer-go/filter` Has some helper functions for building more complex fiters, although we just use a string in our example
6. `github.com/softlayer/softlayer-go/helpers` Contains some functions that might be useful when working some of the more complex API calls, like ordering. A good souce of example on how the softlayer-go client makes API calls as well
7. `github.com/softlayer/softlayer-go/examples` Has some simple examples.

### Main()

```go {linenos=table, linenostart=10}
func main() {
        // softlayer-go/session looks for username and apikey in ~/.softlayer file
        // or the SL_USERNAME/SL_API_KEY environment variables.
        sess := session.New()
        sess.Debug = true
```

This sets up our `main()` function, which is required for any go program. From there it sets up a new [`session`](https://github.com/softlayer/softlayer-go#sessions) object. By default it will look in the ~/.softlayer config file, or environment variables for your username and API key so you don't have to put them in the code itself. While [SLDN](https://sldn.softlayer.com) has some examples where the username/api key is passed directly to `session.New()` this is a bit of a bad practice.

From there it sets `sess.Debug = true` which tells the softlayer-go library to print out all the API calls and results, which can be useful in understanding what exactly is going on under the hood.


### The API Call

```go {linenos=table, linenostart=16}
        objectMask := "mask[id,hostname,domain]"

        // Looks for hostname starting with `spectrum`
        filterObject := string(`{"hardware":{"hostname":{"operation":"^=spectrum"}}}`)
        servers, err := services.GetAccountService(sess).Filter(filterObject).Mask(objectMask).GetHardware()
```

In this example we are making an API call to the [`SoftLayer_Account`](https://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Account/) service, which has a [`GetHardware()`](https://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Account/getHardware/) method. In golang any public method or property must start with a capital letter, which is why here the method is `GetHardware` but in the documentation it is `getHardware`. The same applies for any property returned, they will all need to start with a capital letter, as we will see as we continue this example.

Because `SoftLayer_Account::getHardware()` returns a [SoftLayer_Hardware](https://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/datatypes/SoftLayer_Hardware/) object, our object mask can include any property listed on the [SoftLayer_Hardware](https://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/datatypes/SoftLayer_Hardware/) datatype page. Here we just select the local properties `id, hostname, domain`. Read more about [Object Masks](https://sldn.softlayer.com/article/object-masks/)

Next we setup an [Object Filter](https://sldn.softlayer.com/article/object-filters/), which are generally optional. For this example though we just want to get any hardware that have a hostname that starts with the string `spectrum`. Here we setup a simple string filter, but more complex filters might benefit from using the [Filter Builder](https://github.com/softlayer/softlayer-go#filter-builder). Since this filter is using the `Account` service, the filter needs to start at the [SoftLayer_Account](https://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/datatypes/SoftLayer_Account/) datatype (unlike the object mask).

Lastly, we put all these pieces together to make an API call. Most API calls will return 2 objects, the first being whatever the API method itself is set to return (in this case a map of `SoftLayer_Hardware` objects), and an error if there was one. Usually this is an either/or situation, you won't ever get an error and data back.


### Error handling

```go {linenos=table, linenostart=21}
        if err != nil {
                fmt.Printf("\n Unable to get server object:\n - %s\n", err)
                return
        }
```

Generally if there is an error, simply printing out a message and the actual error itself is enough.


### Printing the result

```go {linenos=table, linenostart=25}
        fmt.Printf("Id, Hostname, Domain\n")
        for _,server := range servers {
            // use `sl.Get()` since API results are always memory addresses. This helper function makes
            // them a little easier to use
            fmt.Printf("%v, %v, %v\n", sl.Get(server.Id), sl.Get(server.Hostname), sl.Get(server.Domain))
        }
```

Printing out data is usually simple enough. The only thing you might need to be aware of is that the results of the API calls are all going to be pointers. In this example we use `sl.Get()` to resolve those pointers, but the following would work too:

`fmt.Printf("%v, %v, %v\n", *server.Id, *server.Hostname, *server.Domain)`


### Updating Services and Datatypes

The services and datatypes packages are kept updated monthly (although not usually attached to a new version every month). If for some reason there is an API you want to use, but not included in the latest version, please let us know about it on our [github issues](https://github.com/softlayer/softlayer-go/issues) page.

To update those manually however, you will need to run [`make generate`](https://github.com/softlayer/softlayer-go/blob/master/Makefile#L41) in the softlayer-go library in your build, and use the [replace](https://go.dev/doc/modules/gomod-ref#replace) directive in go.mod to make sure go uses the local softlayer-go when building your app.

```
cd ~/go/src/github.com/softlayer/softlayer-go/
git pull origin master
make generate
```

If you dont have make installed:
`go run tools/main.go tools/loadmeta.go tools/common.go tools/version.go generate`
