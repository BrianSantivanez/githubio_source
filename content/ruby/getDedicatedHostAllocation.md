The first thing you need to get is a list of the Dedicated Hosts on your account. To list the Dedicated Hosts on your account you can use the following code:


```ruby

require 'softlayer_api' 
require 'pp' 

# Connect to SoftLayer
client = SoftLayer::Client.new(:timeout => 120)

getDediHosts = client['SoftLayer_Account'].getDedicatedHosts
pp getDediHosts
```


Once you have the Dedicated Host ID you can use the following code to retrieve the resource allocations on the host.

```ruby
=begin

=end

require 'softlayer_api' 
require 'pp' 

# Connect to SoftLayer
client = SoftLayer::Client.new(:timeout => 120)

dedicated_host_id = 10501

getAllocStats = client['SoftLayer_Virtual_DedicatedHost'].object_with_id(dedicated_host_id).getAllocationStatus

pp getAllocStats
```
