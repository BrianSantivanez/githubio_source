The first thing you need to get is a list of the Dedicated Hosts on your account. To list the Dedicated Hosts on your account you can use the following code:

```ruby

require 'softlayer_api' 
require 'pp' 

# Connect to SoftLayer
client = SoftLayer::Client.new(:timeout => 120)

getDediHosts = client['SoftLayer_Account'].getDedicatedHosts
pp getDediHosts
```

Once you have the Dedicated Host ID you can use the following code to migrate the Virtual Guest to another host. This script will kick of an immediate migration of the Virtual Guest.

```ruby 

=begin

=end

require 'softlayer_api' 
require 'pp' 

# Connect to SoftLayer
client = SoftLayer::Client.new(:timeout => 120)

destinationHostId = 10001
vsiId = 37167483

migrateGuest = client['SoftLayer_Virtual_Guest'].object_with_id(vsiId).migrateDedicatedHost(destinationHostId)
pp migrateGuest
```
