Operation: `POST`

Method: [`SoftLayer_Product_Order::placeOrder()`](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Product_Order/placeOrder/)

URL: SoftLayer_Product_Order/verifyOrder`

#### Getting the proper priceId
You can use the following [python example](https://softlayer.github.io/python/list_packages/) to get a list of all the available priceId's for the Virtual_Guest package. You need to change the second to last line from `main.getPackage(126)` to `main.getPackage(46)`. The priceId you need will depend on if you are moving to or from Local Storage and the size of the current primary drive.

Example CURL:
```
curl --user "$SOFTLAYER_USERNAME:$SOFTLAYER_API_KEY" -X POST --data @migrate.json
https://api.softlayer.com/rest/v3/SoftLayer_Product_Order/verifyOrder
```
