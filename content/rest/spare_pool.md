Filtering by hardwareStatus->status doesn't work, you will need to filter by the status id only.

Status id 23 is SPARE_POOL
Status id 5 is ACTIVE
```
curl -su userid:api_key 'https://api.softlayer.com/rest/v3/SoftLayer_Account/getHardware?objectMask=mask[id,hostname,hardwareStatus[status,id]]&objectFilter={"hardware":{"hardwareStatus":{"id":{"operation":23}}}}'
```
