# Order a new server.
#
# Building a SoftLayer_Container_Product_Order object for a new
# server order and pass it to the SoftLayer_Product_Order API service to order
# it. In this care we'll order a Xeon 3460 server with 2G RAM, 100mbit NICs,
# 2000GB bandwidth, a 500G SATA drive, CentOS 5 32-bit, and default server
# order options. See below for more details.
