 * Retrieve a list of switch port statistics for a server's network interfaces.
 * 
 * This script makes a single call to the getPortStatistics() method in the
 * SoftLayer_Network_Component API service
 * for each of a server's network components to query port statistics for that
 * interface from SoftLayer's switches. Port statistics are modeled by the
 * SoftLayer__Container_Network_Port_Statistic data type
 * See below for more details.
