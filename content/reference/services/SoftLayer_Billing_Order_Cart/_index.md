title: "SoftLayer_Billing_Order_Cart"
description: "The [[SoftLayer_Billing_Order_Cart]] service allows customers to save their order in a state that can be continually modified. The difference between a cart and a quote is that a quote has locked-in prices while a cart does not. This allows customers to save their order configuration for up to 30 days. After 30 days, the cart is deleted and cannot be retrieved again. "
