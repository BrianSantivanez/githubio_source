# [SoftLayer_User_Customer_OpenIdConnect](/reference/services/SoftLayer_User_Customer_OpenIdConnect)::getUserIdForPasswordSet


Retrieve a user id using a password request key


## Overview 
Retrieve a user id using a password token provided to the user in an email generated by the SoftLayer_User_Customer::initiatePortalPasswordChange request. Password recovery keys are valid for 24 hours after they're generated. 

When a new user is created or when a user has requested a password change using initiatePortalPasswordChange, they will have received an email that contains a url with a token.  That token is used as the parameter for getUserIdForPasswordSet.  Once the user id is known, then the SoftLayer_User_Customer object can be retrieved which is necessary to complete the process to set or reset a user's password.
