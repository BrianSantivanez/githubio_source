title: "declineInvitation"
description: "Declines an invitation to link an OpenIdConnect identity to a SoftLayer (Atlas) identity and account. Note that this uses a registration code that is likely a one-time-use-only token, so if an invitation has already been processed (accepted or previously declined) it will not be possible to process it a second time.
