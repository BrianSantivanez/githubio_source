title: "SoftLayer_Network_LBaaS_Member"
description: "The SoftLayer_Network_LBaaS_Member service allows consumers to manage (backend) members for a given load balancer. A load balancer may have one or more backend pools. Adding a backend member to the load balancer will add that member to all the backend pools. Similarly, deleting a backend member from the load balancer will remove that member from all associated backend pools. Weight of the backend member is a value between 1 and 256 but only applicable when the load balancing method configured is 'Weighted Round Robin'. "
