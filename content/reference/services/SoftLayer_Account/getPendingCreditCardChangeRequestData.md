# [SoftLayer_Account](/reference/services/SoftLayer_Account)::getPendingCreditCardChangeRequestData


Retrieve details of all credit card change requests which have not been processed by a SoftLayer agent.


## Overview 
Before being approved for general use, a credit card must be approved by a SoftLayer agent. Once a credit card change request has been either approved or denied, the change request will no longer appear in the list of pending change requests. This method will return a list of all pending change requests as well as a portion of the data from the original request.
