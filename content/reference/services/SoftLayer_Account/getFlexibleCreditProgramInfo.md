# [SoftLayer_Account](/reference/services/SoftLayer_Account)::getFlexibleCreditProgramInfo

<div class="deprecated"><span class="deprecation-label">Deprecated </span></div>

[DEPRECATED] Please use SoftLayer_Account::getFlexibleCreditProgramsInfo. This is no longer an accurate representation of discounts. 


## Overview 
[DEPRECATED] Please use SoftLayer_Account::getFlexibleCreditProgramsInfo. 

This method will return a [SoftLayer_Container_Account_Discount_Program]({{<ref "reference/datatypes/SoftLayer_Container_Account_Discount_Program">}}) object containing the Flexible Credit Program information for this account. To be considered an active participant, the account must have an enrollment record with a monthly credit amount set and the current date must be within the range defined by the enrollment and graduation date. The forNextBillCycle parameter can be set to true to return a SoftLayer_Container_Account_Discount_Program object with information with relation to the next bill cycle. The forNextBillCycle parameter defaults to false. Please note that all discount amount entries are reported as pre-tax amounts and the legacy tax fields in the [SoftLayer_Container_Account_Discount_Program]({{<ref "reference/datatypes/SoftLayer_Container_Account_Discount_Program">}}) are deprecated.
