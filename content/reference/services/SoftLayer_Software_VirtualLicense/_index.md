title: "SoftLayer_Software_VirtualLicense"
description: "SoftLayer_Software_VirtualLicense is the application class that handles a special type of Software License.  Most software licenses are licensed to a specific hardware ID;  virtual licenses are designed for virtual machines and therefore are assigned to an IP Address.  Not all software packages can be 'virtual licensed'. 

SoftLayer_Software_VirtualLicense's service allows you to retrieve the hard-copy license file for a virtual license, if one exists for your license instance. 

You can also retrieve the subnet that the IP to which a software virtual license is licensed upon exists in, as well as the software description that this virtual license is for. "
