Rebuild Juniper vSRX HA Gateway


## Overview 
Rebuild a vSRX gateway with HA cluster by destroying existing vSRX and installing new vSRX on both gateway servers, then creating HA cluster between 2 vSRX. This is a destructive process which will remove existing vSRX configuration and stop all gateway capabilities. vSRX will need to be re-configured after this operation.
