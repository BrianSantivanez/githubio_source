# [SoftLayer_Network_Gateway](/reference/services/SoftLayer_Network_Gateway)::createObject


Create a new server gateway


## Overview 
Create and return a new gateway. This object can be created with any number of members or VLANs, but they all must be in the same pod. By creating a gateway with members and/or VLANs attached, it is the equivalent of individually calling their createObject methods except this will start a single asynchronous process to setup the gateway. The status of this process can be checked using the status field.
