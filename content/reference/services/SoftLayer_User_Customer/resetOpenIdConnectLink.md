title: "resetOpenIdConnectLink"
description: "This method will change the IBMid that a SoftLayer user is linked to, if we need to do that for some reason. It will do this by modifying the link to the desired new IBMid. NOTE:  This method cannot be used to 'un-link' a SoftLayer user.  Once linked, a SoftLayer user can never be un-linked. Also, this method cannot be used to reset the link if the user account is already Bluemix linked. To reset a link for the Bluemix-linked user account, use resetOpenIdConnectLinkUnifiedUserManagementMode. "
