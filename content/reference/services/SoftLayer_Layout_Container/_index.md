title: "SoftLayer_Layout_Container"
description: "Layout containers are used in the customization of the Portal 4 customer experience. 

A single page in the portal can be thought of as a layout container. The container houses individual [SoftLayer_Layout_Item](reference/datatypes/SoftLayer_Layout_Item), which are the elements of the page (e.g., Ticket list). Layout containers can be added to [SoftLayer_Layout_Profile](reference/datatypes/SoftLayer_Layout_Profile), allowing for full customization of the container's related items. "
