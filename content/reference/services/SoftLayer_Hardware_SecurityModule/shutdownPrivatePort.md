# [SoftLayer_Hardware_SecurityModule](/reference/services/SoftLayer_Hardware_SecurityModule)::shutdownPrivatePort


Disconnect a server's private network interface.


## Overview 
Disconnect a server's private network interface. This operation is an alias for calling [SoftLayer_Hardware_Server::setPrivateNetworkInterfaceSpeed]({{<ref "reference/services/SoftLayer_Hardware_Server/setPrivateNetworkInterfaceSpeed">}}) with a $newSpeed of 0 and unspecified $redundancy. 

Receipt of a response does not indicate completion of the configuration change. Any subsequent attempts to request the interface change speed or state, while changes are pending, will result in a busy error. 

A response of true indicates a change was required to disconnect the interface; thus changes are pending. A response of false indicates the interface was already disconnected, and thus no changes are pending.
