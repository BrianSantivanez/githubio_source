title: "SoftLayer_Layout_Profile_Preference"
description: "The profile preferences are an aggregation of the default preferences and the customized preferences. 

For each [SoftLayer_Layout_Profile_Containers](reference/datatypes/SoftLayer_Layout_Profile_Containers) on a [SoftLayer_Layout_Profile](reference/datatypes/SoftLayer_Layout_Profile), the [SoftLayer_Layout_Preference](reference/datatypes/SoftLayer_Layout_Preference) are inherited through the profile preferences. However, any one of these may be overridden through the [[SoftLayer_Layout_Profile::modifyPreference()]] method. Rather than maintaining two different sets of preferences, all preferences are grouped together through the profile preferences, presenting the customized preferences in place of the default preferences they are overriding.
