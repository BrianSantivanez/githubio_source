title: "SoftLayer_Layout_Profile_Preference"
description: "The profile preferences are an aggregation of the default preferences and the customized preferences. 

For each [[SoftLayer_Layout_Profile_Containers|associated container]] on a [[SoftLayer_Layout_Profile|profile]], the [[SoftLayer_Layout_Preference|default preferences]] are inherited through the profile preferences. However, any one of these may be overridden through the [[SoftLayer_Layout_Profile::modifyPreference()]] method. Rather than maintaining two different sets of preferences, all preferences are grouped together through the profile preferences, presenting the customized preferences in place of the default preferences they are overriding.
