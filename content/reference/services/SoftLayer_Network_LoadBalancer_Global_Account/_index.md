description: "The global load balancer service has been deprecated and is no longer available. 

A global load balancer account enables you to load balance traffic between servers that are in geographically diverse locations.  SoftLayer's global load balancers act as a highly modified DNS server.  SoftLayer's global load balancers work by accepting DNS requests for a specific hostname, choosing a host from a load balancing pool using the load balance method specified, and returning a destination IP address through a DNS response.
