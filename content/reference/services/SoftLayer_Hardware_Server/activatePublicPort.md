# [SoftLayer_Hardware_Server](/reference/services/SoftLayer_Hardware_Server)::activatePublicPort


Activate a server's public network interface.


## Overview 
Activate a server's public network interface to the maximum available speed. This operation is an alias for [SoftLayer_Hardware_Server::setPublicNetworkInterfaceSpeed]({{<ref "reference/services/SoftLayer_Hardware_Server/setPublicNetworkInterfaceSpeed">}}) with a $newSpeed of -1 and a $redundancy of "redundant" or unspecified (which results in the best available redundancy state). 

Receipt of a response does not indicate completion of the configuration change. Any subsequent attempts to request the interface change speed or state, while changes are pending, will result in a busy error. 

A response of true indicates a change was required to activate the interface; thus changes are pending. A response of false indicates the interface was already active, and thus no changes are pending.
