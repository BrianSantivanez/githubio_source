description: "Layout items are used in the customization of the Portal 4 customer experience. 

Each [SoftLayer_Layout_Container](reference/datatypes/SoftLayer_Layout_Container) in the portal contains one or more layout items. These are used to describe elements such as ticket lists. Layout items typically have [SoftLayer_Layout_Preference](reference/datatypes/SoftLayer_Layout_Preference), which can be customized once the container is added to a [SoftLayer_Layout_Profile](reference/datatypes/SoftLayer_Layout_Profile).
