description: "Invoice tax types allows the SoftLayer system to categorize the different strategies we use to calculate the tax for any invoice. There are three basic strategies in our system: don't calculate tax at all, use a basic, location-based set of rules, or offload the tax calculation to a third party that will take all related factors into account.
