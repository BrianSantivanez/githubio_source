description: "Create an address translation for a network tunnel. 

To create an address translation, ip addresses from an assigned /30 static route subnet are used.  Address translations deliver packets to a destination ip address that is on a customer (remote) subnet. 

NOTE:  A network tunnel's configurations must be applied to the network device in order for an address translation to be created. "
