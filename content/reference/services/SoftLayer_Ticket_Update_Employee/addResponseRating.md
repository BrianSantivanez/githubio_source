# [SoftLayer_Ticket_Update_Employee](/reference/services/SoftLayer_Ticket_Update_Employee)::addResponseRating


Set an update's response rating.


## Overview 
As part of the customer service process SoftLayer has provided a quick feedback mechanism for its customers to rate the responses that its employees give on tickets. addResponseRating() sets the rating for a single ticket update made by a SoftLayer employee. Ticket ratings have the integer values 1 through 5, with 1 being the worst and 5 being the best. Once the rating is set ''addResponseRating()'' returns a boolean true.
