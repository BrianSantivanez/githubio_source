title: "SoftLayer_Scale_Group"
description: "A scale group can contain a number of guest members which can fluctuate up and down, staying within a defined range, manually or automatically based on policies given. Groups are set of VLANs to be placed behind. Groups can also have static hardware/guests pinned to the group. These static resources can be used to effect things like moving averages for policy triggers but are not counted as group members and are not subject to automatic reclaim. "
