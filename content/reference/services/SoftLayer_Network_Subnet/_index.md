description: "This service enables interaction with subnets assigned to your account. IP addresses used on your network are drawn from your assigned subnets. 

Primary subnets are assigned as needed and are reclaimed when no longer in use. Primary IP addresses assigned to your devices are drawn from your primary subnets, and the consumption of these IP addresses is tracked and discoverable herein. 

Secondary subnets are assigned when ordered and are reclaimed when canceled. The consumption of IP addresses is not tracked. 

Both IPv4 and IPv6 subnets are supported via this service. 

Subnets can be tagged for discoverability and tracking purposes. "
