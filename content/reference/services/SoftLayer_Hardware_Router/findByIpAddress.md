# [SoftLayer_Hardware_Router](/reference/services/SoftLayer_Hardware_Router)::findByIpAddress


Find hardware by its primary public or private IP (ipv4) address.


## Overview 
The '''findByIpAddress''' method finds hardware using its primary public or private IP address. IP addresses that have a secondary subnet tied to the hardware will not return the hardware. If no hardware is found, no errors are generated and no data is returned.
