# [SoftLayer_Hardware_Router](/reference/services/SoftLayer_Hardware_Router)::rebootHard


Reboot the server via "hard" reboot.


## Overview 
The '''rebootHard''' method reboots the server by issuing a cycle command to the server's remote management card. A hard reboot is equivalent to pressing the ''Reset'' button on a server - it is issued immediately and will not allow processes to shut down prior to the reboot. Completing a hard reboot may initiate system disk checks upon server reboot, causing the boot up to take longer than normally expected. 

Remote management commands are unable to be executed if a reboot has been issued successfully within the last 20 minutes to avoid server failure. Remote management commands include:
