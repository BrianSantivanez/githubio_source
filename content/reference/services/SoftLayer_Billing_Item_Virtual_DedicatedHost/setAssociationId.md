# [SoftLayer_Billing_Item_Virtual_DedicatedHost](/reference/services/SoftLayer_Billing_Item_Virtual_DedicatedHost)::setAssociationId


Set the associated billing item for an orphan billing item.


## Overview 
Set an associated billing item to an orphan billing item. Associations allow you to tie an "orphaned" billing item, any non-server billing item that doesn't have a parent item such as secondary IP subnets or StorageLayer accounts, to a server billing item. You may only set an association for an orphan to a server. You cannot associate a server to an orphan if the either the server or orphan billing items have a cancellation date set.
