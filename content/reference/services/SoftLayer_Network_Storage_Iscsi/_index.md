title: "SoftLayer_Network_Storage_Iscsi"
description: "SoftLayer's iscsi product extends upon the base functionality of SoftLayer offerings by providing snapshot and replication capabilities. An iscsi volume is mounted through SoftLayer's private network and allows for block level additional storage on a highly redundant disk array. SoftLayer's iscsi offering is capable of taking volume snapshots which can be mounted read-only or used for an immediate volume data restore. This high-end Storage offering is also capable of being configured for remote data replication to any of SoftLayer's datacenters to provide a solid disaster recovery solution. "
