description: "SoftLayer provides its customers the ability to add an additional layer of security to the SoftLayer customer portal by requiring that a user login and authenticate with a trusted 3rd party before they are given access to their SoftLayer account.  This is accomplished by creating an external binding for a specific vendor such as PhoneFactor. When the SoftLayer user attempts to log in to the SoftLayer customer portal or VPN, they will first be prompted for their normal SoftLayer username and password.  Once that information is verified they will be asked to authenticate via phone, SMS or mobile phone application. Once authenticated with the trusted vendor the user will be allowed access to the SoftLayer customer portal or VPN. 

The Phone external binding service allows a user to create an external binding, enable, disable, or unlock an external binding, and delete an external binding. 

Once a SoftLayer user has a valid and active external binding, they will be required to always use their credential to login to the SoftLayer customer portal.  In addition any user with an active external binding will be prohibited from using the API. "
