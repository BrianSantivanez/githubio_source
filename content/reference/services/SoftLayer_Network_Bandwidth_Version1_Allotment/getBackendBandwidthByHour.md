# [SoftLayer_Network_Bandwidth_Version1_Allotment](/reference/services/SoftLayer_Network_Bandwidth_Version1_Allotment)::getBackendBandwidthByHour

<div class="deprecated"><span class="deprecation-label">Deprecated </span></div>

[DEPRECATED] return a collection of private usage objects that contain hourly incoming and outgoing network traffic amounts for a 24 hour period. 


## Overview 
[DEPRECATED] This method recurses through all servers on a Bandwidth Pool for 24 hour time span starting at a given date/time. To get the private data set for all servers on a Bandwidth Pool from midnight Feb 1st, 2008 to 23:59 on Feb 1st, you would pass a parameter of '02/01/2008 0:00'.  The ending date / time is calculated for you to prevent requesting data from the server for periods larger than 24 hours as this method requires processing a lot of data records and can get slow at times.
