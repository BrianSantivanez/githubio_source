title: "getBackendBandwidthByHour"
description: "[DEPRECATED] This method recurses through all servers on a Bandwidth Pool for 24 hour time span starting at a given date/time. To get the private data set for all servers on a Bandwidth Pool from midnight Feb 1st, 2008 to 23:59 on Feb 1st, you would pass a parameter of '02/01/2008 0:00'.  The ending date / time is calculated for you to prevent requesting data from the server for periods larger than 24 hours as this method requires processing a lot of data records and can get slow at times.
