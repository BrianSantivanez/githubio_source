# [SoftLayer_Hardware_SecurityModule750](/reference/services/SoftLayer_Hardware_SecurityModule750)::reloadOperatingSystem


Reloads operating system configuration.


## Overview 
Reloads current or customer specified operating system configuration. 

This service has a confirmation protocol for proceeding with the reload. To proceed with the reload without confirmation, simply pass in 'FORCE' as the token parameter. To proceed with the reload with confirmation, simply call the service with no parameter. A token string will be returned by this service. The token will remain active for 10 minutes. Use this token as the parameter to confirm that a reload is to be performed for the server. 

As a precaution, we strongly  recommend backing up all data before reloading the operating system. The reload will format the primary disk and will reconfigure the server to the current specifications on record. 

The reload will take AT MINIMUM 66 minutes.
