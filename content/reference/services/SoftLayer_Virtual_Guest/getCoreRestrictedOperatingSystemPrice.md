title: "getCoreRestrictedOperatingSystemPrice"
description: "If the virtual server currently has an operating system that has a core capacity restriction, return the associated core-restricted operating system item price. Some operating systems (e.g., Red Hat Enterprise Linux) may be billed by the number of processor cores, so therefore require that a certain number of cores be present on the server. "
