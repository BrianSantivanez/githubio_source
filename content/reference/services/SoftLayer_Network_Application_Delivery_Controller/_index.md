title: "SoftLayer_Network_Application_Delivery_Controller"
description: "SoftLayer_Network_Application_Delivery_Controller controls a single instance of SoftLayer's application delivery controller offerings. Application delivery controllers are capable of application filtering, layer 4 and layer 7 load balancing, and many other functions. Currently SoftLayer employs them as high power load balancers. Load balancing is accomplished similarly to SoftLayer's other load balancer options, through a collection of virtual IP address interfaces. 

Application delivery controllers support an 'advanced' configuration scheme, enabling access directly to the controller's backend management interface. Enable access to this interface via the [SoftLayer_Network_Application_Delivery_Controller::enableAdvancedView](/reference/datatypes/$1/#$2) method in this service. Use the username 'root' and password retrieved from this service along with the management IP address retrieved from this service. Be warned that direct access to the application delivery controller exposes a high degree of functionality. Be careful when directly editing your service to avoid interruption via misconfiguration. "
