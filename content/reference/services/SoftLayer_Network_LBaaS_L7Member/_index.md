title: "SoftLayer_Network_LBaaS_L7Member"
description: "The SoftLayer_Network_LBaaS_L7Member service allows consumers to manage (backend) members for L7 pools. A load balancer may have one or more L7 backend pools. A member can be added to one or more L7 backend pools. Deleting a backend member from one L7 pool will not remove it from other L7 pools to which it is associated. Weight of the backend member is a value between 1 and 256 but only applicable when the load balancing method configured is 'Weighted Round Robin'. "
