title: "SoftLayer_Ticket_Group"
description: "SoftLayer tickets have the ability to be assigned to one of SoftLayer's internal departments. The department that a ticket is assigned to is modeled by the SoftLayer_Ticket_Group data type. Ticket groups help to ensure that the proper department is handling a ticket. Standard support tickets are created from a number of pre-determined subjects. These subjects help determine which group a standard ticket is assigned to. "
