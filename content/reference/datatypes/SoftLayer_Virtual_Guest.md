title: "SoftLayer_Virtual_Guest"
description: "The virtual guest service provides a common interface to any virtualization platform supported by SoftLayer. The interaction with various third party APIs is not needed when implementing this service to administer your guests. The SoftLayer_Virtual_Guest service also controls individual CloudLayer Computing Instances purchased from SoftLayer in a way that is analogous to the [[SoftLayer_Hardware_Server]] service's control over physical hardware purchased form SoftLayer.
