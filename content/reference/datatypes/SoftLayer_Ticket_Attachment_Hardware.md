title: "SoftLayer_Ticket_Attachment_Hardware"
description: "SoftLayer tickets have the ability to be associated with specific pieces of hardware in a customer's inventory. Attaching hardware to a ticket can greatly increase response time from SoftLayer for issues that are related to one or more specific servers on a customer's account. The SoftLayer_Ticket_Attachment_Hardware data type models the relationship between a piece of hardware and a ticket. Only one attachment record may exist per hardware item per ticket. "
