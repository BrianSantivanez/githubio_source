This object cannot be accessed by ID, and cannot be modified. The user can access this object through Hardware_Server->availableMonitoring. 

There are two values on this object that are important: 
# monitorLevel determines the highest level of SoftLayer_Network_Monitor_Version1_Query_Type object that can be placed in a monitoring instance on this server
# responseLevel determines the highest level of SoftLayer_Network_Monitor_Version1_Query_ResponseType object that can be placed in a monitoring instance on this server
