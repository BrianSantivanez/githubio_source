description: "The SoftLayer_User_Customer_Notification_Virtual_Guest object stores links between customers and the virtual guests they wish to monitor.  This link is not enough, the user must be sure to also create SoftLayer_Network_Monitor_Version1_Query_Host instance with the response action set to 'notify users' in order for the users linked to that Virtual Guest object to be notified on failure.
