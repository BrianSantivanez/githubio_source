title: "SoftLayer_Dns_Domain_ResourceRecord_AaaaType"
description: "SoftLayer_Dns_Domain_ResourceRecord_AaaaType is a SoftLayer_Dns_Domain_ResourceRecord object whose ''type'' property is set to 'aaaa' and defines a DNS AAAA record on a SoftLayer hosted domain. An AAAA record directs a host name to an IPv6 address. For instance if the AAAA record for 'host.example.org' points to the IPv6 address 'fe80:0:0:0:0:0:a00:0' then the ''host'' property for the AAAA record equals 'host' and the ''data'' property equals 'fe80:0:0:0:0:0:a00:0'.
