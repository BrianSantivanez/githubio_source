title: "SoftLayer_Network_Gateway"
description: "A network gateway is a set of members which have a configurable set of VLANs trunked through them. This is helpful for creating proxies. Each network gateway can have a configurable set of hardware and VLANs within the same pod routed to it. Gateways can be bypassed or unbypassed either as a whole or for specific VLANs. They are also provided gateway VLANs for management that are never bypassed. Members cannot be simply removed once attached to a gateway, they must be reclaimed. "
