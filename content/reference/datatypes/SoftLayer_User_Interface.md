title: "SoftLayer_User_Interface"
description: "A SoftLayer_User_Interface represents a generic user instance within the SoftLayer API. The SoftLayer API uses SoftLayer_User_Interfaces in cases where a user object could be one of many types of users. Currently the [SoftLayer_User_Customer](reference/datatypes/SoftLayer_User_Customer) and [SoftLayer_User_Employee](reference/datatypes/SoftLayer_User_Employee) classes are abstracted by this type. "
