description: "This container can be used to configure the phone authentication mode. By default, 'VOICE_CALL' in 'STANDARD' mode with no Pin number will be used. With the default mode, you will have to answer a phone call from a trusted 2 form factor vendor during authentication process. You have to answer the call and follow the instruction in order to complete the authentication. 

You can also use SMS text message or PhoneFactor mobile app modes (in case you're using PhoneFactor). Additionally, you can set up a Pin number. By requiring you to verify your secret PIN, you can ensure that you have possession of your phone. "
