title: "SoftLayer_Network_Subnet"
description: "A subnet represents a continguous range of IP addresses. The range is represented by the networkIdentifer and cidr/netmask properties. The version of a subnet, whether IPv4 or IPv6, is represented by the version property. 

When routed, a subnet is associated to a VLAN on your account, which defines its scope on the network. Depending on a subnet's route type, IP addresses may be reserved for network and internal functions, the most common of which is the allocation of network, gateway and broadcast IP addresses. 

An unrouted subnet is not active on the network and may generally be routed within the datacenter in which it resides.
