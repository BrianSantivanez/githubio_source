title: "SoftLayer_Network_Subnet"
description: "Every SoftLayer ip address is associated with a subnet which is defined in the SoftLayer_Network_Subnet service. SoftLayer subnets define a group of ip addresses and are assigned to a SoftLayer_Network_Vlan.  The SoftLayer_Network_Subnet service gives you information about your subnet such as your network address, broadcast address, the subnet gateway address, and the total number of IP addresses within the subnet. Use the data returned by these methods with other API services to get more detailed information about your services. 

Along with VLANs, subnets are an integral part of the SoftLayer network. Each server ordered by SoftLayer comes with at least one public and one private subnet, with more available for order in the customer portal. Subnets exist in the SoftLayer network as either interfaces on a VLAN or as route destination from an IP address or VLAN. 

SoftLayer customers can order and manage subnets through the customer portal. If you need to cancel a subnet please open a sales ticket in our customer portal and our account management staff will assist you. "
