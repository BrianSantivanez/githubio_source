title: "SoftLayer_Location_Status"
description: "SoftLayer_Location_Status models the state of any location. SoftLayer uses the following status codes: 


*'''ACTIVE''': The location is currently active and available for public usage.
*'''PLANNED''': Used when a location is planned but not yet active.
*'''RETIRED''': Used when a location has been retired and no longer active.


Locations in use should stay in the ACTIVE state. If a locations status ever reads anything else and contains active hardware then please contact SoftLayer support. "
