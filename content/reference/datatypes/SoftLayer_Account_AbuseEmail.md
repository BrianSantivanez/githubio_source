title: "SoftLayer_Account_AbuseEmail"
description: "An unfortunate facet of the hosting business is the necessity of with legal and network abuse inquiries. As these types of inquiries frequently contain sensitive information SoftLayer keeps a separate account contact email address for direct contact about legal and abuse matters, modeled by the SoftLayer_Account_AbuseEmail data type. SoftLayer will typically email an account's abuse email addresses in these types of cases, and an email is automatically sent to an account's abuse email addresses when a legal or abuse ticket is created or updated.
