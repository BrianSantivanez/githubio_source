title: "SoftLayer_User_Customer_External_Binding_Phone"
description: "The SoftLayer_User_Customer_External_Binding_Phone data type contains information about an external binding that uses a phone call, SMS or mobile app for 2 form factor authentication. The external binding information is used when a SoftLayer customer logs into the SoftLayer customer portal or VPN to authenticate them against a trusted 3rd party, in this case using a mobile phone, mobile phone application or land-line phone. 

SoftLayer users with an active external binding will be prohibited from using the API for security reasons. "
