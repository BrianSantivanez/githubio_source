title: "SoftLayer_Ticket_Attachment_Dedicated_Host"
description: "SoftLayer tickets have the ability to be associated with specific dedicated hosts in a customer's inventory. Attaching a dedicated host to a ticket can greatly increase response time from SoftLayer for issues that are related to one or more specific hosts on a customer's account. The SoftLayer_Ticket_Attachment_Dedicated_Host data type models the relationship between a dedicated host and a ticket. Only one attachment record can exist per dedicated host item per ticket. "
