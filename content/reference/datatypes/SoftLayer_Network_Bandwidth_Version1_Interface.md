description: "[DEPRECATED] All bandwidth tracking is maintained through the switch that the bandwidth is used through.  All bandwidth is stored in a 'pod' repository.  An interface links the hardware switch with the pod repository identification number. This is only relevant to bandwidth data.  It is not common to use this. "
