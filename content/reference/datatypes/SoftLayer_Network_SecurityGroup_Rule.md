title: "SoftLayer_Network_SecurityGroup_Rule"
description: "The SoftLayer_Network_SecurityGroup_Rule data type contains general information for a single rule that belongs to a [SoftLayer_Network_SecurityGroup](reference/datatypes/SoftLayer_Network_SecurityGroup). By default, all traffic (both inbound and  outbound) to a virtual server instance is blocked. Security group rules are permissive, and define the allowed incoming (ingress) and outgoing (egress) traffic to both the public and private interfaces of a  virtual server instance. The order of rules within a security group does not matter and priority always falls to the least restrictive rule. "
