title: "SoftLayer_User_Customer_CustomerPermission_Permission"
description: "Each SoftLayer portal account is assigned a series of permissions that determine what access the user has to functions within the SoftLayer customer portal. This status is reflected in the SoftLayer_User_Customer_Status data type. Permissions differ from user status in that user status applies globally to the portal while user permissions are applied to specific portal functions. "
