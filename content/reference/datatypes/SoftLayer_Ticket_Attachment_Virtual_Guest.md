title: "SoftLayer_Ticket_Attachment_Virtual_Guest"
description: "SoftLayer tickets have the ability to be associated with specific virtual guests in a customer's inventory. Attaching virtual guests to a ticket can greatly increase response time from SoftLayer for issues that are related to one or more specific servers on a customer's account. The SoftLayer_Ticket_Attachment_Virtual_Guest data type models the relationship between a virtual guest and a ticket. Only one attachment record may exist per virtual guest per ticket. "
