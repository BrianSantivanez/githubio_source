description: "VLANs comprise the fundamental segmentation model on the network, isolating customer networks from one another. 

VLANs are scoped to a single network, generally public or private, and a pod. Through association to a single VLAN, assigned subnets are routed on the network to provide IP address connectivity. 

Compute devices are associated to a single VLAN per active network, to which the Primary IP Address and containing Primary Subnet belongs. Additional VLANs may be associated to bare metal devices using VLAN trunking.
