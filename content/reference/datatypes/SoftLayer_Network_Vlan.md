description: "The SoftLayer_Network_Vlan data type models a single VLAN within SoftLayer's public and private networks. a Virtual LAN is a structure that associates network interfaces on routers, switches, and servers in different locations to act as if they were on the same local network broadcast domain. VLANs are a central part of the SoftLayer network. They can determine how new IP subnets are routed and how individual servers communicate to each other. "
