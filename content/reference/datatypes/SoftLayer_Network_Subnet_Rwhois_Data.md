title: "SoftLayer_Network_Subnet_Rwhois_Data"
description: "Every SoftLayer customer account has contact information associated with it for reverse WHOIS purposes. An account's RWHOIS data, modeled by the SoftLayer_Network_Subnet_Rwhois_Data data type, is used by SoftLayer's reverse WHOIS server as well as for SWIP transactions. SoftLayer's reverse WHOIS servers respond to WHOIS queries for IP addresses belonging to a customer's servers, returning this RWHOIS data. 

A SoftLayer customer's RWHOIS data may not necessarily match their account or portal users' contact information. "
