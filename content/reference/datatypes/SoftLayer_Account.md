title: "SoftLayer_Account"
description: "Every SoftLayer customer has an account which is defined in the SoftLayer_Account service. SoftLayer accounts have users, hardware, and services such as storage and domains associated with them. The SoftLayer_Account service is a convenient way to obtain general information about your SoftLayer account. Use the data returned by these methods with other API services to get more detailed information about your services and to make changes to your servers and services. 

SoftLayer customers are unable to change their company account information in the portal or the API. If you need to change this information please open a sales ticket in our customer portal and our account management staff will assist you. "
