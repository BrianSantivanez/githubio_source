description: "Use this datatype to upgrade your existing monthly-billed server to term based pricing. Only monthly to 1 year, and 1 year to 3 year migrations are available. A new billing agreement contract will be created upon order approval, starting at the next billing cycle. A price is required for each existing billing item and all term-based prices must match in length. Hourly billed servers are not eligible for this upgrade. Downgrading to a shorter term is not available. Multiple term upgrades per billing cycle are not allowed. "
