#### API
- Removed all guest-related methods from SLDN exposure on the SoftLayer_Virtual_Host class, since customer-managed guests are no longer available as a product and therefore host information is not exposed to customers for their guests.
- Update volumeStatus as string in case of ISCSI volume
- Updated SLDN Documentation for SoftLayer_User_Customer_ApiAuthentication to match behavior
- Deprecate Autoscale for Classic API methods
- Adding new package names to Sendgrid product items.
- Clarify 2nd event log entry for IAM Token good with 2FA failure

#### Backend
- Prefer keeping the same IP addresses when restarting a provision
- Added code to delete networks after the deletion of provisioning network in SoftLayer_Virtual_Host
- Unroute static subnets targeting primary IP addresses upon host reclaim.
