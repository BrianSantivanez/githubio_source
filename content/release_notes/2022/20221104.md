#### API
- Properly handle upgrade rules when block/file volume is magnetic
- Removed the dead PhoneFactor code
- Allow for editing a firmware driver version entries
- Add new guest attribute type for ACTIVE_LIVE_MIGRATION
- Made the SoftLayer_Hardware_Server::virtualGuests ORM key return an empty collection for customers (SLDN calls), since we no longer offer customer-managed-guests and therefore customers do not need to know host/server information for their guests anymore.
- Fully deprecated SoftLayer_Network_Vlan::secondaryRouter


#### Backend
- Fixed an issue where block and file snapshot counts where not accurate
